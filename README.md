# vscode-timer README

Timer Extension for VS Code - Set timer to keep track of deadlines or to get breaks between coding sessions.

## Features

* Set timer with commonly used durations
* View time remaining in status bar (usually at bottom)
* Click on status bar to cancel or reset timer


For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
